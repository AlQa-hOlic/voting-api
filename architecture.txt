Architecture

The application is built with best practices in mind.

The packages are structured into the following directories which have their own responsibilities:

- controllers: REST API endpoints accessed by the consumers
- dto: Data transfer pojos that are usually used to map data from/to the REST APIs
- exceptions: Various application specific exceptions that are used to handle intentional exceptions gracefully
- repository: Data layer of the application that handles information persistence
- services: Classes used to encapsulate the business logic of the application
